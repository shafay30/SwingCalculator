# SwingCalculator
This program is a Java Swing-based calculator with a simple graphical interface for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input complete mathematical expressions directly and receive results by clicking the equal button. The interface includes buttons for numbers, decimal points, operators, and functionality to clear or delete inputs.

Limitations:
- The calculator only supports basic arithmetic operations and does not handle complex expressions like those with parentheses or 
  exponentiation.
- Operator precedence is not fully respected; operations are evaluated sequentially from left to right, which may lead to incorrect 
  results for certain expressions.
- Error handling is minimal and may display incorrect results or "Error" for invalid input or division by zero.
